# Quickstart

This document presents a brief, high-level overview of Robotoffâ€™s library primary features. This guide will cover:

- Using OFF dataset

## Installation

Robotoff is currently only compatible with Python 3.7.
Robotoff can be installed easily with pip: `pip3 install robotoff`

## Using the dataset

First, download the dataset: ```python3 -m robotoff download-dataset```

Robotoff includes a set of tools to easily handle the OFF dataset.
As an example, we can print the product name of all complete products from France that have ingredients in French with:

```
from robotoff.products import ProductDataset

ds = ProductDataset.load()

product_iter = (ds.stream()
                  .filter_by_country_tag('en:france')
                  .filter_nonempty_text_field('ingredients_text_fr')
                  .filter_by_state_tag('en:complete')
                  .iter())

for product in product_iter:
    print(product['product_name'])
```

We first lazily load the dataset using `ProductDataset.load()`.
Then, we create a ProductStream using the `ProductDataset.stream()` method, and apply filters on the stream of products.

The following filters are currently available:
- filter_by_country_tag
- filter_by_state_tag
- filter_nonempty_text_field
- filter_empty_text_field
- filter_nonempty_tag_field
- filter_empty_tag_field
- filter_by_modified_datetime
